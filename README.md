# Covid_Vaccination Booking Website

Hello everyone, 
As Covid cases are rising, we have a website that can help book the slot to get vaccinated on an early promise. 

The USER Privileges:
  1. Users need to log in first, then can avail of the slot.
  2. Users can view the vaccination centers and can search the centers using working hours.
     
The ADMIN Privileges:
  1. Admin can add Vaccination Centers
  2. Delete the centers
  3. Get dosage details of Centers

For the front end, I have used React JS, and for styling used Tailwindcss to develop a Simple UI.
For the back end, Node JS, Express JS.
For database, MongoDB.
